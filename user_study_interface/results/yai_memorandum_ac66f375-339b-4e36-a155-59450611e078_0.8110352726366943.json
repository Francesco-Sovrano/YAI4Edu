    "qualitative_feedback": "I particularly liked the layout that included 'what, why, how', as it made the explanations easy to follow. Also the language did not have a negative connotation, such as 'mental impairment' that appeared in the previous explanation. The headings that had long sentences, lost me before I began and I found it hard to decipher the explanations."
