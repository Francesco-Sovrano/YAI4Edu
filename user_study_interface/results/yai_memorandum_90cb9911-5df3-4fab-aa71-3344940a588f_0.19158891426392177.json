    "qualitative_feedback": "Some of the explanations headings and paragraphs explained either little or no information about the topic itself while still referencing other cases where the topic would apply thus not really giving a good grasp on it. If cases are referenced then they should be used in tandem with the well detailed explanations to get the reader a grasp on the idea whoever it be."
