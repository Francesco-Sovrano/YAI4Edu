    "qualitative_feedback": "The third model of explanation proved to be unsatisfactory for all three topics. In the third model, the explanations do not follow a logical order, are incomplete and often contain incorrect or irrelevant elements. The explanations in models 1 and 2 are quite complete. Model 1 seems to fit more practical questions, while model 2 fits more theoretical ones.  In my opinion, model 2 is preferable for the topic at hand."
