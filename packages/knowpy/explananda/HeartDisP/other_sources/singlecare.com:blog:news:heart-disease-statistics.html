		<p>The heart is an icon, one that adorns greeting cards, appears in jewelry shop windows, or adds a special touch to an affectionate text message. It symbolizes love, passion, and commitment. And that’s because it’s our most vital organ. The heart’s significance goes far beyond emoji confessionals and construction paper creations—it’s the fist-sized engine that keeps our bodies going.</p>
		<p>Problems with the heart mean problems for the whole body, so it’s understandable why heart disease is such a prominent public health concern. Whether we’re talking about blood pressure, abnormal heartbeats, blood vessel issues, or heart attacks, it’s important to understand the risk factors, symptoms, and conditions associated with heart disease.</p>

		<h2 id="what-is-heart-disease">What is heart disease?</h2>
		<p>Heart disease, also called cardiovascular disease (CVD), is an umbrella term that encompasses several different conditions that affect the heart. These include heart muscle disease (cardiomyopathy), irregular heartbeats (arrhythmia), and blood vessel issues like peripheral or coronary artery disease. Nearly half of Americans have some type of heart disease.</p>
		<p>Most cardiovascular diseases stem from interference with the heart’s normal function. Plaque buildup, blood clots, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and obesity can all contribute to heart disease. Many of these conditions are preventable by maintaining a healthy lifestyle and diet.</p>
		<p>Each heart condition has different symptoms, but common warning signs include chest pain or pressure, shortness of breath, numb or cold extremities, fatigue, and lightheadedness. A healthcare provider may ask about these conditions as part of a complete physical exam to help diagnose heart disease. He or she may also order blood tests, stress tests, an electrocardiogram (EKG), or imaging tests like an X-ray, CT scan, ultrasound, or MRI.</p>

		<h2 id="causes-risks-treatment-of-heart-disease">Causes of heart disease</h2>
		<p>Now that we have the sobering numbers out of the way, let’s get to the root of the issue. What causes heart disease in the first place? There’s a long list of cardiovascular risk factors; some are controllable while others aren’t. For example, age, race, and family health history can put someone at a higher risk, but they aren’t personal choices. However, there are plenty of risk factors that are influenced by our lifestyle choices, such as:</p>
		<ul>
		<li>Physical inactivity</li>
		<li>Poor diet</li>
		<li>Tobacco use</li>
		<li>High cholesterol</li>
		<li>Obesity</li>
		<li><a href="https://www.singlecare.com/conditions/diabetes-treatment-and-medications">Diabetes</a></li>
		<li>High blood pressure</li>
		<li>Alcohol use</li>
		</ul>
		<p>And that’s not all. A person’s environment can affect heart health, too. Social determinants like poverty, housing insecurity, education, and lack of insurance can have a significant influence on one’s cardiovascular health. Without access to resources and the ability to maintain a healthy diet, exercise, etc., a person will be more susceptible to heart disease.</p>
		<h2>How to prevent heart disease</h2>
		<p>There’s no changing family history or age, but there are still plenty of ways to keep heart disease at bay. “Diet is the cornerstone to preventing heart disease, and physical activity is another key player,” says <a href="http://www.integrated.doctor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Anthony Kaveh</a>, MD, an integrated medicine specialist.</p>
		<p>Keeping an eye on blood cholesterol and weight is key, too, as high cholesterol and obesity are major risk factors. Abstaining from tobacco use and excessive alcohol consumption also go a long way in preventing CVD. Healthy stress management strategies and adequate sleep put the cherry on top. Essentially, avoiding controllable risk factors just comes down to leading a holistically healthy life.</p>
		<p>But preventative measures work differently for each person, according to Dr. Kaveh. “The key is finding strategies that resonate with each individual,” he says. “Just like how the same blood pressure medication may not work the same in two different individuals, the same lifestyle strategies may not work the same for everybody. We all bring our own histories and experiences to our health, and we need to find integrated approaches that resonate with our experiences to engage in healthy lifestyle choices consistently.”</p>
		<p>Dr. Kaveh encourages his patients that there’s a lot of value in small lifestyle alterations. “Our small choices every day have a tremendous cumulative impact,” he says. “More importantly, it appears that it is never too late to reap the benefits of a heart-protective lifestyle.”</p>

		<h2>Treating heart disease</h2>
		<p>Of course, CVD treatments vary based on the condition and its severity, but several medications can treat common heart disease causes. For patients with high cholesterol, healthcare providers might prescribe statins, a drug class that lowers LDL (“bad cholesterol”), like <a href="https://www.singlecare.com/prescription/lipitor">Lipitor</a> (atorvastatin) or <a href="https://www.singlecare.com/prescription/crestor">Crestor</a> (rosuvastatin). For the nearly half of Americans with hypertension, beta blockers and ACE inhibitors can be useful in lowering blood pressure. Beta blockers like Sectral (<a href="https://www.singlecare.com/prescription/acebutolol-hcl">acebutolol</a>) block the action of adrenaline to slow the heart, treating abnormal rhythms, lowering blood pressure, and helping prevent recurrent heart attacks. ACE inhibitors like <a href="https://www.singlecare.com/prescription/lotensin">Lotensin</a> (benazepril) lower blood pressure by relaxing and widening blood vessels. To help prevent blood clots, healthcare providers may also recommend <a href="https://www.singlecare.com/prescription/aspirin">aspirin</a>, <a href="https://www.singlecare.com/prescription/clopidogrel-bisulfate">clopidogrel</a>, or <a href="https://www.singlecare.com/prescription/warfarin-sodium">warfarin</a>.</p>
		<p>More severe or life-threatening conditions may require surgical procedures like bypass surgery, pacemaker insertion, or stent placement.</p>

		<h2 id="faq">Heart disease questions and answers</h2>
		<h3>What percentage of the population has heart disease?</h3>
		<p>The American Heart Association estimates that 48% of the U.S. population has some type of heart disease.</p>
		<h3>What country has the highest rate of heart disease?</h3>
		<p>World Health Organization data from 2012 indicates that Turkmenistan had the highest heart disease death rate, with 712 deaths per 100,000 people, followed by Kazakhstan, with 635 deaths per 100,000.</p>
		<h3>Is heart disease increasing or decreasing?</h3>
		<p>Deaths related to CVD are declining worldwide, but on the rise in the U.S., according to the American Heart Association.</p>
		<h3>What is the mortality rate of heart disease?</h3>
		<p>Cardiovascular disease causes 1 out of every 4 deaths in the U.S., 198.8 deaths for every 100,000 population.</p>
		<h3>What percent of heart attacks are fatal in the U.S.?</h3>
		<p>Around 10% of heart attacks are fatal. But the fact that one heart attack occurs every 40 seconds in the U.S. means that they still cause numerous deaths. In 2017, coronary heart disease caused 365,914 deaths in America.</p>
		<h3>What is the leading cause of heart disease?</h3>
		<p>An accumulation of cholesterol on artery walls, called atherosclerosis, is the most common cause of cardiovascular disease. Atherosclerosis is generally the result of unhealthy lifestyle behaviors like poor diet, smoking, and lack of exercise.</p>
		<h3>How long has heart disease been the leading cause of death?</h3>
		<p>Heart disease isn’t a new problem for the United States. It’s been the nation’s leading cause of death since 1921, according to <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/285437543_Heart_Disease_and_Stroke_Mortality_in_the_Twentieth_Century" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a 2006 study</a>.</p>
		<h3>What are the early signs of heart disease?</h3>
		<p>Pay attention to chest pain/discomfort, shortness of breath, fatigue, coughing/wheezing, and general weakness, as they can all be heart disease indicators.</p>
		<h3>What are the different types of heart disease?</h3>
		<p>Heart disease is a broad term that describes various cardiovascular conditions, including heart muscle disease (cardiomyopathy), coronary artery disease, arrhythmia (like atrial fibrillation), and congenital heart disease.</p>
